# ping-rs

## Overview

This project aims to be pretty much a carbon copy of [ping](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/ping.c).

__Why?__

I want to improve my understanding of IP and I learn best through doing.

__Why Rust?__

Cos I know Rust and it should suit the project.

__How do I hope to build it?__

I'm going to try NOT to look at previously implemented ping codebases, and instead will read specifications and read [TCP/IP books](https://www.amazon.com/001-Illustrated-Protocols-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633469).

## Development
